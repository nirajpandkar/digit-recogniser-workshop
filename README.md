# Digit Recognizer Workshop

In this workshop we are going a develop and train a deep neural network called convolutional neural network to recognise handwritten digits. We'll be using the MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") dataset, also considered as the "Hello World" dataset in computer vision/deep learning. It contains a large set of human handwritten and annotated digit images.

By the end of the tutorial you will have learnt how convolutional neural networks work, how to deploy pre-trained model, how to visualise the results. We'll build this neural net using tensorflow and deploy the pretrained model as rest api.
